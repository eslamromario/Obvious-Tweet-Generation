    "# @ObviousOstrich Generation Experiment\n",
    "- @obviousostrich is a twitter account [here](!https://twitter.com/search?q=obvious%20ostrich&src=tyah)\n",
    "- Collected all it's tweets 17k tweets using Twitter API.\n",
    "- I wanted to do a small text generation experiment anyway. \n",
    "- **I was skeptical how a bigram-trigram model will work on a little dataset like this. It works nice on reuters dataset.**\n",
    "- **Surprisingly, it does okay.** The reason is the same reason I thought it would fail i.e. it has very little repeatition of words, so it has merged two or max three tweets into one, generating some funny obvious work.\n",
    "- The **biggest downside** of working on this small a dataset is that sometimes it just produces the exaact tweet.\n"
